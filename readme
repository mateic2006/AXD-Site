This project is a web application designed to showcase a portfolio and provide a booking system for services. It includes features such as a portfolio slider, a calendar for selecting dates, and time slots for scheduling appointments.

## Features

### Portfolio Slider
- Displays a slider for showcasing portfolio items.
- Adjusts the number of visible slides based on screen width (1 slide for small screens, 3 slides for larger screens).

### Booking System
- **Date Picker**: Allows users to select a date from a dynamically generated two-week calendar.
- **Time Slots**: Provides selectable time slots for scheduling appointments.
- **Service Selection**: Automatically selects a service based on URL parameters.

### Responsive Design
- The application is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **Portfolio Slider**:
    - The slider functionality is initialized on page load.
    - Navigation buttons allow users to scroll through the portfolio items.

2. **Date Picker**:
    - Generates a two-week calendar starting from the current Monday.
    - Highlights the selected date and updates a hidden input field with the selected date.

3. **Time Slots**:
    - Displays available time slots from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM.
    - Highlights the selected time slot and updates a hidden input field with the selected time.

4. **Service Selection**:
    - Reads the `service` parameter from the URL and pre-selects the corresponding service in the dropdown menu.

## File Structure

- **`js/scripts.js`**: Contains all the JavaScript logic for the portfolio slider, date picker, time slots, and service selection.
- **HTML and CSS**: (Not included in this document) Define the structure and styling of the application.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

## Future Improvements
